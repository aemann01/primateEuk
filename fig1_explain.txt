a) phylogenetic tree of primates in the current data set. Shape indicates genus, color major phylogenetic 
group (new world monkeys, old world monkeys, apes, and lemurs) -- tree generated from 
10.1016/j.ympev.2014.11.001)

b) Weighted unifrac beta diversity of total eukaryotic assemblage, two major groups separate out those 
that are primarily dominated by entamoeba vs those that are primarily fungal (also could be interpreted as 
high vs low overall alpha diversity)

c) Correlation of eukaryotic and bacterial alpha diversity (observed otus)

d) Dendrograms of weighted unifrac beta diversity scores in three major euk groups. A bifurcation higher 
at the y axis indicates a more substantial grouping -- Amoebozoa is the most important in terms of 
defining groups, Nematoda is moderate, and Fungi is the lowest with very few groupings -- even within 
these groups there is very little phylogenetic signal
